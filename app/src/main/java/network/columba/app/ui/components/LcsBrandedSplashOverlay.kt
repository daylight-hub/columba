/**
 * LCS: the "Liberty Chat — powered by Columba" splash wordmark.
 *
 * ## Why the app draws this instead of the system
 *
 * Android's own branding slot, `android:windowSplashScreenBrandingImage`, is
 * API 31+ and platform-only — androidx `core-splashscreen` deliberately does not
 * emulate it, so there is no theme-level way to put the wordmark on Android 10
 * or 11. Relying on it would mean the splash said one thing on a new phone and
 * another on an old one.
 *
 * Embedding the wordmark in the splash *icon* is not a workaround either: on
 * API 31+ the platform masks that icon to a circle and clips the outer third, so
 * a wide logo-plus-text image comes out mangled on exactly the devices where the
 * branding slot would have worked.
 *
 * So the app draws it, on every API level, and the platform branding attribute
 * has been removed from the v31/v33 themes. Every device now shows the same
 * thing: system splash with the logo on white, then this — logo above the
 * wordmark — then the app.
 *
 * ## How it is hosted
 *
 * Declared at the theme root in `MainActivity`, outside the app's `Surface`, so
 * it covers the whole UI while drawing in the same window. Deliberately not a
 * `Dialog`: that would be a separate window, and the frame or two the system
 * takes to attach one is long enough for the app to show through.
 *
 * ## Why [show] exists
 *
 * `setContent` composes the entire tree during `onCreate`, while the system
 * splash is still covering the window. A dwell timer started on composition
 * therefore runs and expires *behind* the splash — which is what happened in
 * 1.2.0, where the wordmark was drawn and removed before the splash ever
 * lifted, leaving users with a logo and no words.
 *
 * [show] is flipped from `SplashScreen.setOnExitAnimationListener` in
 * `MainActivity`, so the dwell starts when the screen is genuinely visible.
 *
 * @param show true once the system splash has left the window.
 * @param visibleDurationMs how long the wordmark stays up before fading.
